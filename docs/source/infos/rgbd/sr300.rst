Intel is now producing a couple different RGBD sensors (F200 and SR300)
to be used in different applications and scenarios.

On ROS
------

.. warning:: I haven't tried this sensor on ROS since the official ROS drivers have been released

To run the Kinect_V2 on ROS, just follow the tutorial for the `realsense_camera <http://wiki.ros.org/RealSense>`_ package
